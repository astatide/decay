# DECAY

Decay is a graphical particle simulator (in the Newtonian sense, not the quantum one) / visualizer written in Rust w/ a wgpu & React app.  I wanted to learn Rust and more modern GPU programming while also continuing to gain expertise in tech stacks I've worked with before.

The goal?  Learn Rust, have some modular components, get a feel for ECS + shaders, and have something that exists in the space between a game and a physics tool.

## Why decay?

Because it's molecular dynamics and written in Rust, something along the lines of oxidation seemed too straightforward; but what is oxidation, if not some sort of decay in a lot of ways?

Also you know, super gothy :bat:

I'm journaling along as I go and writing articles up on my [website](https://astatide.lgbt)
